## Current Stage: Improved Email Validation Status - COMPLETED ✅

Implemented comprehensive email validation with detailed status codes.

**Implemented Status Codes:**

**Pass Statuses (Valid Emails):**
- ✅ Success - Email format valid and domain has MX records
- ✅ ServerIsCatchAll - Mail server accepts all emails

**Fail Statuses (Invalid Emails):**
- ✅ AtSignNotFound - Missing @ symbol
- ✅ DnsConnectionFailure - Could not connect to DNS
- ✅ DnsQueryTimeout - DNS lookup timeout (>5 seconds)
- ✅ DomainDoesNotExist - Domain not found in DNS
- ✅ DomainHasNullMx - Domain exists but has no MX records
- ✅ DomainPartCompliancyFailure - Malformed domain
- ✅ DoubleDotSequence - Contains consecutive dots
- ✅ InvalidAddressLength - Email too long (>254 chars)
- ✅ InvalidCharacterInSequence - Invalid characters
- ✅ InvalidLocalPartLength - Local part too long (>64 chars) or empty
- ✅ UnhandledException - Unexpected error

**Ignore Statuses:**
- ✅ Duplicate - Already checked (skipped)
- ✅ CatchAllValidationTimeout - Timeout during catch-all detection

**Implementation Details:**
- Three-stage validation: Format → DNS → Status Classification
- Efficient batch DNS validation by domain
- Detailed error reporting with specific status codes
- All 87 tests passing
- Documentation updated in README.md
