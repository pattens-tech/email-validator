# Security Implementation Plan

## 1. File Size Protection
- Implement checks to ensure that uploaded files do not exceed a defined size limit.
- Return appropriate error messages if size limits are breached.

## 2. DNS Timeout Protection
- Set a maximum timeout for DNS resolution requests to prevent long waiting times.
- Implement fallback mechanisms if DNS resolution fails.

## 3. Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use libraries or frameworks that provide built-in input validation.

## 4. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address over a specific time period.
- Use tools or libraries that provide rate limiting functionality.

## 5. Security Headers
- Implement security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and others to mitigate various attacks.
- Regularly review and update the security headers as needed.
